# Discord Web Handler

This is a simple web handler for Discord. It is designed to be used with `discord.js`, `express` and `MongoDB (mongoose)`.

If you want to make a discord bot that has a web interface, you can use this as a boilerplate and continue work.

Just clone the repo and start coding. I created this handler for my own use on my freelance projects, but I thought it might be useful for others too. So I decided to make it open source.

If you find any bugs or have any suggestions, please open an issue or a pull request.

If you have any questions, feel free to ask me on Discord: `__dev_anand#7800`
